A plugin for Jenkins already exist : 
 - plugin information page : https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Green+Balls
 - Git hub : https://github.com/jenkinsci/greenballs-plugin

But everybody doesn't have the right to install plugins on large team.
The Chrome extension is for every developer that loves green balls, but can't install this plugin for various reason.

All images was taken from the Green Balls Jenkins plugin.
